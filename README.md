## Learning Outcomes
From working on this project, I reinforced my previously learned concepts and gained valuable insights into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). I learned how to effectively utilize objects to create cleaner, more maintainable code. This project deepened my understanding of encapsulation, abstraction, and the importance of structuring code in a way that promotes reusability and scalability. Overall, it enhanced my problem-solving skills and my ability to develop interactive web applications.
